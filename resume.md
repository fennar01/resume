# Technology Resume

---

<sup>_4th July 2022_</sup>

**Thank you for taking the time to read my resume.** Before you dive in, I wanted to make a couple of notes for you I feel are important so you can best understand what you're reading.

1. _I take accurate representation of my skills seriously and don't stretch the truth nor do I mis-represent my skills. What you see here is what you get._

2. _Due to privacy protection and personal security I do not use social media, however I do host a selection of private GitHub links to my work for your exploration. **If you would like access, please let me know which repos you would like to read and your associated GitHub username/email and I'll add you ASAP**_

3. _This is a publicly available resume/repo, as a result, some personally identifiable features have been left out. If you would like clarification or further details on anything, please get in touch._

## Hard Skills

This section will list out the major part of my technical expertise. It's quite dense, as you can see, but I've done my best to break it into rough categories to make the content more palatable. As with the nature of technology, some category matches are hard to place, so forgive me if anything appears as a category error.

## Projects

### Decentralized Autonomous Organization ([View My Codebase](https://github.com/fennar01/DAO))

I created a Solidity smart contract, where holding a specific NFT token grants access to a DAO. These NFT holders may create proposals that other members of the DAO may then vote on. If there is a majority consensus on a proposal after the voting period has ended the DAO can then move forth on acting on said proposal.

> _Technologies Used:_

> - Solidity
> - React
> - Hardhat
> - Polygon
> - Web3uikit

#### Crypto Algo-Trading Bot ([View My Codebase](https://github.com/fennar01/AlgoTradingBot))

_I wrote an algorithmic cryptocurrency trading bot in Python with a Bloomberg Terminal style front-end. I then re-wrote it in Javascript._

#### Database Reverse Engineering Bot (==Codebase Under Non-Disclosure==)

_Reverse engineers queryable databases using a key/value pair vulnerability to facilitate local exploration. Can be run in conjunction with Kubernetes to increase velocity._

#### Demonstration of the Bernstein-Vazirani Quantum Algorithm ([View My Codebase](https://github.com/fennar01/bernstein-vazirani))

_A proof of concept of an algorithm, invented in 1991 that demonstrated how, theoretically, Quantum Computers could work faster than classical computers under certain conditions. This algorithm is definitive proof._

#### Database Conversion Program (==Codebase Under Non-Disclosure==)

_Part of a wider codebase & project specific. This subrepo takes an existing relational database and utilizing headers, reformats the code and uploads it using API requests, caching and LocalStorage to a NoSQL database. As it progresses, it also displays progress/issues in a User interface that DevOps engineers can use to resolve issues._

#### Firebase/React Recipes App ([View My Codebase](https://github.com/fennar01/firebase-recipies-web-app))

_This was created to demonstrate my ability to build a full stack application. I got react and firebase initialized and working and some relatively decent logic built on the front end._

#### Company Dashboard Chrome Extension ([View My Codebase](https://github.com/fennar01/company-dashboard))

_A chrome extension that showcases company news, the time, local weather etc..._

#### Leads Tracker Chrome Extension ([View My Codebase](https://github.com/fennar01/leads-tracker))

_A chrome extension for sales teams to add leads they find on the internet to their company CRM_

#### Created My Own Cryptocurrency (Tokenized off of the Solana chain) [View FenCoin on Solscan](https://solscan.io/token/8Pm6hMSp4XwCp2tXUBBby2bNqXTDvt7N85PRAoVJ9JtW)

_This was just curiosity and a joke with some friends. If you'd like some, let me know!_
