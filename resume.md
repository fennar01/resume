<sup>_Fennar Ralston - 4th July 2022_</sup>

**Thank you for taking the time to read my resume.** Before you dive in, I wanted to make a couple of notes for you I feel are important so you can best understand what you're reading.

1. _I take accurate representation of my skills seriously and don't stretch the truth nor do I mis-represent my skills. What you see here is what you get._

2. _Due to privacy protection and personal security I do not use social media, however I do host a selection of private GitHub links to my work for your exploration. ==If you would like access, please let me know which repos you would like to read and your associaed GitHub username/email and I'll add you ASAP==_

## Hard Skills

[{#hard-skills}]: #

This section will list out the major part of my technical expertise. It's quite dense, as you can see, but I've done my best to break it into rough cetegories to make the content more digestable for you. As with the nature of technology, some category matches are hard to place, so forgive me if anything appears as a category error.

## Projects

[{#projects}]: #

### Decentralised Autonomous Organisation ([View My Codebase](https://github.com/fennar01/DAO))

I created a Solidity smart contract, where holding a specific NFT token grants access to a DAO. These NFT holders may create proposals that other members of the DAO may then vote on. If there is a majority consensus on a proposal after the voting period has ended the DAO can then move forth on acting on said proposal.

> _Technologies Used:_

Database Conversion Program (==Codebase Under Non-Disclosure==)
: Part of a wider codebase & project specific. This subrepo takes an existing relational database and utilising headers, reformats the code and uploads it using API requests, caching and LocalStorage to a NoSQL database. As it progresses, it also displays progress/issues in a User interface that DevOps engineers can use to resolve issues.

Firebase/React Recipes App ([View My Codebase](https://github.com/fennar01/firebase-recipies-web-app))
: This was created to demonstrate my ability to build a full stack application. I got react and firebase initialised and working and some relatively decent logic built on the front end.
